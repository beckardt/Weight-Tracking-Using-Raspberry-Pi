# How to: Digital Weight Tracking With Raspberry Pi
## By Ben Eckardt and Xavier Hayden

During Short Term 2017 at Bates College, Ben and Xavier set out to hack a digital scale such that it could send its weight readings to a Raspberry Pi, where the readings would be manipulated and sent to a line graph tracking a persons weight. Here is the final product:

And here is a few days of weight tracking for Xavier:
