## Our Daily Progress

Day 3: We became familiar with Cron as a we created a program that would run a python file every 5 minutes.

Day 4: We Programmed our Raspberry Pi to email us its IP address whenever it booted up. This way, we can SSH into the Raspberry Pi from our laptops without the use of a desktop. This is called a headless setup. The first step was creating a python program on the Raspberry Pi that would first get the IP, then email both me and Henry what it found. We did this in a file called getIP.py.


```python

import socket
s = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_DGRAM)
s.connect(("gmail.com", 80))
msg= s.getsockname()[0]
s.close()

import smtplib

server = smtplib.SMTP('smtp.gmail.com',587)
server.starttls()
server.login("scandylyfeofpi@gmail.com", "what'supdoc")

server.sendmail("scandylyfeofpi@gmail.com","xhayden@bates.edu",msg)
server.sendmail("scandylyfeofpi@gmail.com","beckardt@bates.edu",msg)
server.quit()

```

Next, to get the pi to run getIP.py upon rebooting, we entered the following path...
```shell
sudo nano /etc/rc.local
```

Then, inputted the following code. Note that we had the program sleep, because it took the pi a non-negligable amount of time to hook up to the internet. This of course is needed to run getIP.py since it sends an email, so we don't want to have the pi run the program until wifi has been attained. 

```shell
while ! /sbin/ifconfig wlan0 | grep -q 'inet addr:[0-9]'; do
    sleep 3
done
_IP=$(hostname -I) || true
if [ "$_IP" ]; then
  printf "My IP address is %s\n" "$_IP"
  python /home/pi/getIP.py &
fi

exit 0
```
